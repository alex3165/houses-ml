# houses-ml

## notes:

User inputs:

* price
* location

* property_type (default: D, S, T, F)
* old_new (default: both)
* duration (default: both)

Problem to solve:

* Predict date of house to sell depending on user inputs

* Percentage of match from selected location and parameters (might need some manual categorisation)

  * Simpler version: Is it a good area yes or no

* Predict price in the area
  * visualisation (bar chart): Average price paid (y), old_new (x)
